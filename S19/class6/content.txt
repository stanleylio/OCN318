"IoT": TSYS01 readings broadcast to MQTT


Homework:
	Make a live plot of the temperature readings that you publish to the "cloud".
	Bonus if you plot your classmates' readings as well.


Recap:
	The messaging protocol we used is MQTT.

	The Python library we used is paho-mqtt.

	The message broker is broker.hivemq.com
		You can see the status of the broker here:
			http://www.mqtt-dashboard.com/

The channels we use are (case-sensitive!):
	uhm/soest/ocn318/Diana/temperature
	uhm/soest/ocn318/Ollie/temperature
	uhm/soest/ocn318/rayna/temperature

The message format is:
	'{},{}'.format(timestamp, temperature_in_fahrenheit)

Hint:
	When handed a string 'item1,item2,item3...', you can split it into multiple strings with the .split() function:
		'item1,item2,item3'.split(',')
	This will give you a LIST of three strings.
	
	If there is a string that can be converted to a number, use the float() function:
		float('25.00')

	To round a number to N decimal places, use the round() function:
		round(3.141592, N)
