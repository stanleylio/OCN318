	Beat-per-minute estimation





Homework:
Convert this POSIX timestamp, 1518386711, to yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
	You can do it in Python or look it up online. Hint: you will have to do it in Python eventually.
Convert these hexadecimal numbers to decimal: A, FF, DEADBEEF, DECAF
	You should know how to convert at least the first two on paper, <whisper>like on an exam</whisper>. You can use Python/calculator/Google for the remaining two.
