Quiz - plotting temperature data collected over the past week

ADC, thermistor, temperature measurement

measure resistance of thermistor with multimeter
look up datasheet to get temperature
automate this process in Python to build temperature sensor from the ground up


measure resistance of 10k resistor
measure voltage of 10k-10k voltage divider
replace top resistor with 4.7k and measure voltage
replace top resistor with thermistor and measure voltage
